# visuale

An real-time dashboard visualisation for real-world micro-service continous deployment environments 

![A shapshot of an early ersion of the visuale dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cantara/visuale/master/doc/images/Visuale-in-action.png)

#### Legend
- battery symbol: SLA/HA quality. Calculated based on the number of healthy nodes weigthed against distributed system norms
- fuel gauge symbol: the node seems to have been running long, meaning that its infrastructure and dependencies may need security patching
- traffic light symbol: the observed heartbeat state of the node, signalling which nodes which are not healthy

## Test yourself
You may have a look and push data at the latest version which is reset frequently here:

# Some key targets for the project

- :heavy_check_mark: a dashboard which display each service (and each service node) with cached/real info a-la what the /health and/or /info endpoint for each service produce.....   
- :heavy_check_mark: the "cluster" instances should be grouped as a service...   
dashboard service... 
- :heavy_check_mark: the UI should mainly be a static UI meant for big-surveilance screens on the walls...  
- :heavy_check_mark: initial version will be open, i.e. not need any auth... 
- :heavy_check_mark: the UI should be continuously updating...   
- :heavy_check_mark: semantic version, running since and some instance info like internal IP are the most important values....    
- :heavy_check_mark: old/long running services (>7 days) should be marked as insecure/vulnerable due to lack of patching
- :heavy_check_mark: service indicator of the service live resillience/availabillity 
- :heavy_check_mark: mobile friendly - so you can check your environments on the bus on the way to work 
- :white_check_mark: we will support both pull-based info... and pod/instance CRON jobs which push the health json to the 
- :white_check_mark: nodes which have not reported for 10 intervals should be marked with a yellow "not working properly" colour...
- :white_check_mark: nodes which are not reachable or have missed 50 updates should be marked red/dead...  
- :white_check_mark: normal update interval from the service should be 5 or 10 second
- :white_check_mark: The backend should attempt to do some simple semantic mapping for different json health structures
- it might support clicking into a service or a node to see all the details...
