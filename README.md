# visuale

An real-time dashboard visualisation for real-world micro-service continous deployment environments 


* a dashboard which display each service (and each service instance) with cached/real info a-la what the /health and/or /info endpoint for each service produce.....   
* the "cluster" instances should be grouped as a service...   
* we will support both pull-based info... and pod/instance CRON jobs which push the health json to the dashboard service... 
* the UI should mainly be a static UI meant for big-surveilance screens on the walls...  
* it might support clicking into a service or an instance to see all the details...    
* initial version will be open, i.e. not need any auth... 
* the UI should be continuously updating...   
* semantic version, running since and some instance info like internal IP are the most important values....    
* instances which have not reported for 10 intervals should be marked with a yellow "not working properly" colour...
* instances which are not reachable or have missed 50 updates should be marked red/dead...  
* normal update interval from the service should be 5 or 10 second
